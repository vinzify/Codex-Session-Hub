# Changelog

## 0.3.1

- Added the generic `sessionhub` entrypoint for provider discovery and cross-provider help
- Installed `sessionhub` alongside `csx`, `clx`, `opx`, and `cxs` in the public installers
- Routed `fzf` preview and reload helpers through explicit provider flags so the generic entrypoint works inside the picker

## 0.3.0

- Added OpenCode provider support with the new `opx` launcher
- Loaded OpenCode sessions from the local SQLite store and restored preview support in the shared browser
- Added OpenCode resume and delete handling plus installer and shell integration updates

## 0.2.5

- Fixed preview-pane row parsing so project and session previews render again in `fzf`
- Added coverage for prefixed rows that include extra tab-delimited columns

## 0.2.4

- Internal release alignment for the preview-pane fix

## 0.2.3

- Kept the selector open after interactive rename, reset, and delete actions
- Moved interactive delete prompts to stderr so shell wrappers do not swallow them

## 0.2.2

- Added parser coverage for shortcut-based `fzf` output
