## ✨ Features

* **Universal Browse:** Access your Codex sessions across all projects from one powerful command.
* **Smart Resume:** Select a session and instantly resume it in the correct project directory.
* **Persistent Aliases (Rename):** Give your auto-generated sessions meaningful names that stick, so you know exactly what you were working on.
* **Bulk Operations:** Multi-select sessions using `fzf` and bulk delete them without breaking a sweat.
* **Rich Context Previews:** View project summaries and detailed session information in a sleek side pane while browsing.
* **Cross-Platform Compatibility:** Runs flawlessly on PowerShell 7+ whether you are on Windows, macOS, or Linux.

## 💻 Usage & Commands

The main command for Codex Session Hub is `csx`.

```powershell
# Open the fzf browser for all sessions
csx
csx browse

# Open the browser filtered by a specific project name
csx browse desktop

# Rename a specific session to a friendly alias
csx rename <session-id> --name "My friendly alias"

# Revert a session's title back to the auto-generated one
csx reset <session-id>

# Delete a session by its ID
csx delete <session-id>

# Run a system check to verify dependencies and paths
csx doctor
```

### ⌨️ Browser Controls (`csx` / `csx browse`)

Once inside the `fzf` interface, you have access to powerful shortcuts:

| Key Binding | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `Enter` | Resume the focused session |
| `Tab` / `Shift-Tab` | Multi-select sessions |
| `Ctrl-D` | Delete all selected sessions |
| `Ctrl-E` | Rename/Alias the focused session |
| `Ctrl-R` | Reset the focused session's title |
| `Esc` / `Ctrl-C` | Exit the browser |

### 🔍 Search Filtering

While in the browser, you can filter your sessions with special syntax:
* **Text query:** Filters by folder/project name (default)
* **Number query:** Filters by session number prefix
* **`title:<term>`** or **`t:<term>`**: Filters specifically by the session title/alias
